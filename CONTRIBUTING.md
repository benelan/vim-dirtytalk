Adding a new word list
----------------------

You can create a static word list by creating a `wordlists/NEW_LIST_NAME.words`
file. That being said, it is preferred to have a word list automatically
generated by a script in `scripts/` directory. See existing scripts for an
example how to do that. Beware! Most of these scripts are currently ugly,
terrible hacks, which should probably be rewritten from scratch in the first
place.

Changing existing word list
---------------------------

Please never change automatically generated word lists by hand. Instead, adjust
the respective script in `scripts/` directory, then re-run the script before
committing your changes and sending a PR.
